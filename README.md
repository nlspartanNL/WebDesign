# mod.works Design
Design for [mod.works](https://mod.works) a UGC marketplace for game developers, extending [bulma.io](http://bulma.io) framework. A template to help preview your changes can be found in the test/ folder, a [demonstration of it](https://design.mod.works) is here.

## bulma
Our clone of the [bulma repository](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) can be found here. We make minimal changes to it, only comment out unused functionality to keep our compiled CSS filesize down.

## Extensions
3rd party created enhancements for bulma are stored in the extensions/ folder. Our own enhancements are stored in the modworks/ folder.

## Setup
To get the design up and running on your local machine, clone or fork this repository, then point your SASS compiler at the file modworks/bulma.sass. You can output the CSS file to the test/ folder to preview how it will look before submitting your contribution.
