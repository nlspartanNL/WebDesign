## Viewing the documentation
Instead of documentation, the files here are a [live preview](https://design.mod.works) of how your changes to the SASS files will affect the layout of [mod.works](https://mod.works)
To get the design up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Point your SASS compiler at the file bulma.sass
3. Output the bulma.css file to the docs/ folder
4. Load [index.html in the docs folder](https://design.mod.works) to preview how your changes will look before submitting your contribution
